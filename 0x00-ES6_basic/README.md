## Introduction to ES6

ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is a major update to the JavaScript language. It introduces several new features and syntax enhancements that make JavaScript more powerful and expressive.

## Let and Const

The `let` and `const` keywords are used for declaring variables in ES6. They provide block-level scoping and offer better control over variable assignment and reassignment.

## Arrow Functions

Arrow functions are a concise syntax for writing anonymous functions in JavaScript. They provide a more compact and readable way to define functions, especially for one-liners.

## Template Literals

Template literals are an enhanced way of working with strings in JavaScript. They allow for easy interpolation of variables and multiline strings, making string manipulation more flexible.

## Destructuring Assignment

Destructuring assignment is a feature that allows you to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables in a concise way. It simplifies the process of accessing nested data structures.

## Default Parameters

Default parameters allow you to specify default values for function parameters. If a parameter is not provided, the default value will be used instead.

## Rest and Spread Operators

The rest and spread operators are powerful tools for working with arrays and objects. The rest operator allows you to gather multiple values into an array, while the spread operator allows you to spread an array or object into individual elements.

## Classes

ES6 introduces a new syntax for defining classes in JavaScript. Classes provide a way to create reusable blueprints for objects, allowing for object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

## Modules

Modules are a way to organize and share code in JavaScript. They allow you to split your code into separate files and import/export functionality between them, promoting modularity and reusability.

## Promises

Promises are a mechanism for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They provide a cleaner and more structured way to work with asynchronous code, avoiding callback hell.

## Async/Await

Async/await is a syntax for writing asynchronous code in a more synchronous style. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code, making it easier to reason about and debug.
